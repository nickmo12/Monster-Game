# Monster-Game
A console based text adventure game.

The game creates a player object using information from a file, builds a dungeon of three rooms each containing a monster, and allows the player to challenge the monsters one-by-one and explore for treasure. The game displays messages on the screen to tell the user what happens. It also creates a log file that keeps a record of the game.
